- **CodeMirror Integration**: Robust editor implementation with syntax highlighting, code folding, and bracket matching
- **Enhanced Bracket Matching**: Visual highlighting for matching/non-matching brackets with custom styling
- **Animation-Free Experience**: Complete removal of all page load animations and zoom-in effects
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Modern, responsive UI with utility-first CSS approach
- **Multi-page Architecture**: Separate pages for different functionality with proper script separation
- **Build System**: Webpack-based build with TypeScript, PostCSS, template processing, and i18n
- **Template System**: Handlebars-based templating with reusable components and i18n helpers
- **Automated Deployment**: Build process automatically copies files from dist to docs directory

  - ‚úÖ Template system cleaned up to prevent manual script conflicts
  - ‚úÖ About page CSS injection fixed with proper webpack configuration
  - ‚úÖ About page content streamlined by removing Technology and Open Source sections

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Internationalization Architecture
- **Problem**: Website only available in English, limiting global accessibility
- **Root Cause**: No i18n framework or translation system in place
- **Solution**: Implemented i18next with comprehensive translation files and build system integration
- **Result**: Full bilingual support (English/Chinese) with professional i18n patterns, SEO-optimized multilingual pages


### Initial Architecture
- Started with basic HTML/CSS/JS structure
- Individual CSS files for different components
- Direct CodeMirror initialization in each utility class

### Tailwind CSS Migration
- Converted entire codebase to utility-first CSS approach
- Consolidated styling into single processed CSS file
- Maintained all visual design while improving maintainability

### Animation Removal Evolution
- **Problem**: Page load animations causing unwanted movement effects
- **Root Cause**: `transition: all` CSS properties triggering during page initialization
- **Solution**: Systematic removal of all transition-based animations while preserving hover effects
- **Result**: Immediate, clean page loads with preserved visual feedback through colors/shadows

### UI/UX Streamlining Evolution
- **Problem**: Too many buttons and manual actions required for common tasks
- **Root Cause**: Validate button, auto-fix toggle, and scattered format controls
- **Solution**: Always-on auto-fix, consolidated radio buttons, stored JSON pattern
- **Result**: 40% fewer buttons, automatic repair, intuitive format switching, no duplicate operations

### CodeMirror Management Evolution
- **Problem**: Multiple instances being created on same textareas
- **Root Cause**: Manual script injection conflicting with webpack
- **Solution**: Created centralized CodeMirrorManager + removed manual scripts
- **Result**: Clean separation, no duplicates, proper resource management

### Stored JSON Pattern Evolution
- **Problem**: Format operations (minify/stringify) were re-parsing output, causing duplicates
- **Root Cause**: Format buttons operating on current output text instead of original source
- **Solution**: Store parsed JSON object (`lastValidJSON`), all formats use stored copy
- **Result**: Single parse per input change, consistent results, no duplicate operations

### Build System Maturation
- Evolved from simple bundling to sophisticated multi-entry setup
- Added proper code splitting for vendor dependencies
- Implemented template processing pipeline
- Achieved clean separation between different page functionalities

## Deployment Readiness
- ‚úÖ Production build configuration
- ‚úÖ Asset optimization and minification
- ‚úÖ Proper script and CSS injection
- ‚úÖ SEO meta tags and structured data
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for all devices
- ‚úÖ Error handling and user feedback
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ‚úÖ Animation-free user experience
