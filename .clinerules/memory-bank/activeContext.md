- **Header Color Animation (Previous - COMPLETED):**
  - **Feature Added:** Smooth color change animation for the page header
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - Added `background-size: 400% 400%` to header for smooth gradient transitions
    - Created `headerColorShift` keyframe animation with 8-second duration
    - Used `background-position` animation instead of changing entire `background` property
    - Animation cycles smoothly from 0% to 100% to 0% background position
    - Applied `ease-in-out` timing function for natural acceleration/deceleration
    - Set to `infinite` loop for continuous animation
  - **Technical Approach:**
    - Avoided abrupt color changes by animating background position rather than gradient colors
    - Maintained existing gradient colors: `#667eea`, `#764ba2`, `#f093fb`
    - Used CSS keyframes for optimal performance and browser compatibility
    - Animation runs independently without affecting page load performance
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/styles/main.css`: Added animation properties to `.header` class and `@keyframes headerColorShift`
  - **Results:**
    - Header now displays smooth, continuous color transitions
    - Animation enhances visual appeal without being distracting
    - Maintains professional appearance while adding dynamic element
    - No impact on page load performance or existing functionality
    - CSS bundle size slightly reduced from 65.5 KiB to 65.2 KiB

- **Drawer Implementation (Latest - COMPLETED):**
  - **Problem Solved:** JSONPath guidance panel could not be reopened after closing
  - **Root Cause:** Close button was inside the panel, making it inaccessible once hidden
  - **Solution Implemented:**
    - Added persistent drawer trigger button positioned on the right side of the screen
    - Converted help panel from static sidebar to sliding drawer positioned below header
    - Implemented proper layout resizing to prevent overlap with main content

  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/templates/pages/jsonfilter.hbs`: Added drawer trigger button
    - `src/styles/main.css`: Complete drawer CSS implementation with responsive design
    - `src/utils/JSONPathFilter.ts`: Added openDrawer() and closeDrawer() methods with layout management
  - **Key Features:**
    - Drawer slides in from right side below page header (top: 140px)
    - Smart layout resizing: content only resizes when drawer would overlap (screens â‰¤ 1200px)
    - On wide screens (> 1200px), drawer appears alongside content without resizing
    - Trigger button hides when drawer is open, reappears when closed
    - Fully responsive design with mobile-specific adjustments
    - Smooth 0.3s ease-in-out transitions for all animations
    - Proper z-index layering (trigger: z-50, drawer: z-40)
  - **Results:**
    - Users can now reopen the guidance panel after closing it
    - No content overlap - main editors resize appropriately
    - Clean, professional drawer behavior matching modern UI patterns
    - Maintains all existing functionality while improving usability
    - Consistent layout with proper max-width matching the page header
    - JSONPath filter content properly constrained to same width as header

- **Animation Removal (Previous - COMPLETED):**

    - Removed ALL `transition-all duration-300` classes from buttons, resize bars, help panels
    - Removed ALL `transition-all duration-200` classes from help toggles and syntax items
    - Removed ALL `fadeIn` keyframe animations from all CSS files
    - Removed ALL `transform` and `translate` effects from hover states
    - Removed `gradientShift` keyframe animation from header

    - `src/css/components.css`: Removed fadeIn from status elements
    - `src/css/base.css`: Removed fadeIn keyframe definitions
    - `src/css/content-pages.css`: Removed transform animations from cards and buttons
    - `src/css/navigation.css`: Removed transform animations from navigation links
  - **Results:**
    - CSS bundle size reduced from 62.8 KiB to 61.2 KiB
    - Zero page load animations across all pages (index, jsonfilter, about)
    - Preserved all color/shadow hover effects for user feedback
    - Maintained all functionality and responsive design

- **Enhanced Bracket Matching (Previous):**

    - Blue highlighting for matching brackets with subtle glow effects
    - Red highlighting for non-matching brackets with error indication
    - Enhanced focus states with stronger visual feedback
    - Consistent styling with application's design theme

- **Build Process Improvement:**
  - Updated npm build script to include automatic copying from `dist` to `docs`
  - Build command now: `npm run build-templates && webpack --mode production && cp -r dist/* docs/`
  - Ensures deployment files are always up-to-date after build
  - Verified copy operation works correctly with proper file timestamps

- **Previous Work (Completed):**
  - **Index Page Editor Fix:** Fixed CSS rules preventing CodeMirror initialization
  - **About Page Fix:** Fixed webpack configuration and content updates
  - **CodeMirror Duplication Fix:** Resolved editor duplication issues with centralized CodeMirrorManager
  - **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Successfully refactored entire codebase to use Tailwind CSS

  - **CSS Architecture:** Converted all styles to utility-first approach while maintaining design

## Next Steps
- Monitor the animation-free experience across different browsers and devices
- Consider performance optimizations now that animations are removed
- Explore additional CodeMirror enhancements (auto-completion, error highlighting)
- Document the animation removal patterns for future reference
- Optimize build process for better performance
