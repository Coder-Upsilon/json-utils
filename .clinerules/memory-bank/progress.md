# Progress

## What Works
- **JSON Processing**: Complete JSON formatting, validation, minification, and conversion functionality
- **JSONPath Filtering**: Full JSONPath expression support for filtering and querying JSON data
- **CodeMirror Integration**: Robust editor implementation with syntax highlighting, code folding, and bracket matching
- **Enhanced Bracket Matching**: Visual highlighting for matching/non-matching brackets with custom styling
- **Animation-Free Experience**: Complete removal of all page load animations and zoom-in effects
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Modern, responsive UI with utility-first CSS approach
- **Multi-page Architecture**: Separate pages for different functionality with proper script separation
- **Build System**: Webpack-based build with TypeScript, PostCSS, and template processing
- **Template System**: Handlebars-based templating with reusable components
- **Automated Deployment**: Build process automatically copies files from dist to docs directory

## What's Left to Build
- **Additional JSON Utilities**: Potential for more advanced JSON manipulation features
- **Performance Optimizations**: Bundle size optimization and lazy loading
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: More detailed error messages and recovery mechanisms
- **Testing Suite**: Unit and integration tests for all functionality
- **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Core Functionality**: All primary JSON utilities are working
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX**: Complete responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- ‚úÖ **Animation-Free Design**: Zero page load animations, preserved hover effects
- ‚úÖ **CodeMirror Integration**: Fixed duplication issues, centralized management
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Webpack configuration optimized for multi-entry setup
- ‚úÖ **Template Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with Handlebars
- üîÑ **Deployment**: Ready for production deployment
- ‚è≥ **Testing**: Needs comprehensive test coverage
- ‚è≥ **Documentation**: Basic documentation exists, could be expanded

## Known Issues
- **None Currently**: All major issues have been resolved
- **Previous Issues (Resolved)**:
  - ‚úÖ Page load animations removed completely (CSS bundle reduced 62.8 KiB ‚Üí 61.2 KiB)
  - ‚úÖ CodeMirror duplication fixed with centralized manager
  - ‚úÖ Webpack script injection conflicts resolved
  - ‚úÖ Template system cleaned up to prevent manual script conflicts
  - ‚úÖ About page CSS injection fixed with proper webpack configuration
  - ‚úÖ About page content streamlined by removing Technology and Open Source sections

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture
- Started with basic HTML/CSS/JS structure
- Individual CSS files for different components
- Direct CodeMirror initialization in each utility class

### Tailwind CSS Migration
- Converted entire codebase to utility-first CSS approach
- Consolidated styling into single processed CSS file
- Maintained all visual design while improving maintainability

### Animation Removal Evolution
- **Problem**: Page load animations causing unwanted movement effects
- **Root Cause**: `transition: all` CSS properties triggering during page initialization
- **Solution**: Systematic removal of all transition-based animations while preserving hover effects
- **Result**: Immediate, clean page loads with preserved visual feedback through colors/shadows

### CodeMirror Management Evolution
- **Problem**: Multiple instances being created on same textareas
- **Root Cause**: Manual script injection conflicting with webpack
- **Solution**: Created centralized CodeMirrorManager + removed manual scripts
- **Result**: Clean separation, no duplicates, proper resource management

### Build System Maturation
- Evolved from simple bundling to sophisticated multi-entry setup
- Added proper code splitting for vendor dependencies
- Implemented template processing pipeline
- Achieved clean separation between different page functionalities

## Deployment Readiness
- ‚úÖ Production build configuration
- ‚úÖ Asset optimization and minification
- ‚úÖ Proper script and CSS injection
- ‚úÖ SEO meta tags and structured data
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for all devices
- ‚úÖ Error handling and user feedback
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ‚úÖ Animation-free user experience
