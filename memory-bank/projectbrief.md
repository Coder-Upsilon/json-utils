# Project Brief: json-utils

This project is a JavaScript utility library, likely for handling JSON data, built with TypeScript and Webpack.

## Core Requirements and Goals
- Provide utility functions for JSON manipulation.
- Maintain a clean and organized codebase.
- Ensure `node_modules` is ignored by Git, while `dist` is tracked.
- Push the codebase to a GitHub repository.
