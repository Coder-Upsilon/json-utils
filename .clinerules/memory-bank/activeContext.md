# Active Context - JSON Utils Website

## Current Status: TYPESCRIPT CONVERSION COMPLETED ✅

The JSON Utils website has been successfully converted to TypeScript and can now be built as a static website using modern build tools.

## What Was Built

A comprehensive web-based JSON utility tool with the following features:

### Core Features Implemented
1. **JSON Formatting**
   - Pretty Print: Formats JSON with proper indentation
   - Minify: Compresses JSON to single line format

2. **JSON Validation**
   - Real-time validation with status indicators
   - Detailed error messages with suggestions
   - Comprehensive JSON analysis (type, properties, size)

3. **Format Conversion**
   - JSON to YAML conversion with proper indentation
   - JSON to XML conversion with proper structure and escaping

4. **JSON Correction**
   - Auto-fix common JSON errors using the official `jsonrepair` package
   - Handles single quotes, trailing commas, unquoted keys, etc.

5. **User Interface Features**
   - Copy output to clipboard
   - Download output as files (.json, .yaml, .xml, .txt)
   - Load sample JSON data
   - Clear input functionality
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technical Implementation

### TypeScript Architecture
- **Type-safe code**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces and types
- **Modern build system**: Webpack-based build with TypeScript compilation
- **Professional dependencies**: Uses official `jsonrepair` and `codemirror` packages
- **Static website output**: Builds to optimized static files in `dist/` directory

### Build System
- **Webpack 5**: Modern bundling with code splitting and optimization
- **TypeScript**: Full type checking and compilation
- **CSS processing**: Minification and extraction for production
- **Development server**: Hot reload development environment
- **Production optimization**: Minified bundles with content hashing

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── index.ts          # Main TypeScript entry point
├── index.html        # HTML template
└── styles.css        # Styling

dist/                 # Built static website
├── index.html        # Generated HTML with asset references
├── main.[hash].js    # Compiled and minified JavaScript
├── main.[hash].css   # Processed and minified CSS
└── vendors.[hash].js # Third-party dependencies bundle
```

## Build Commands
- `npm run build` - Production build to `dist/` directory
- `npm run dev` - Development server with hot reload
- `npm run type-check` - TypeScript type checking only

## Testing Results

All functionality has been thoroughly tested in the built version:
- ✅ JSON formatting (pretty print and minify)
- ✅ JSON validation with detailed analysis
- ✅ YAML conversion with proper formatting
- ✅ XML conversion with proper structure
- ✅ JSON auto-correction using jsonrepair package
- ✅ Copy to clipboard functionality
- ✅ Responsive design and user interface
- ✅ TypeScript compilation and build process
- ✅ Static website deployment ready

## Files Created
### Source Files
- `src/index.ts` - Main TypeScript application
- `src/index.html` - HTML template
- `src/styles.css` - Complete styling and responsive design

### Build Configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `webpack.config.js` - Webpack build configuration

### Output
- `dist/` - Complete static website ready for deployment

## Next Steps
The project is now a modern TypeScript application that builds to a static website. The `dist/` directory contains the complete, optimized website ready for deployment to any static hosting service.
